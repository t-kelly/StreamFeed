# StreamFeed

Create an web app that displays a content feed that is populated in real-time from pluggable sources (Stream Chat, Github Discussions, Twitter mentions) and allow a streamer to showcase a this content on their live stream with a simple click. Integrates with OBS through browser sources + custom browser docks. Inspired by Restream Studio + Streamyard's message highlight feature.

## Problem
- The only way to do this right now is with a paid service
- Current solutions are limited to chat + predefined messages
- Current solutions are not easily integrated into OBS

## Why this is important
- We want to highlight developer community activity on future streams. I want an easy way to do this.

## Solution
- **NextJS**: Web App because they've impressed me with their getting started guide and I want to get my hands dirty
- **Tailwind CSS**: Because I want to try out their new Just-in-time service for compiling
- **OBS Studio**: Because it's easy to customize and contribute new features towards
- **Open-Source**: Because so far this is for fun and want others to benefit from this work
- **Live-streamed**: Because I'm trying to be 'hip' and 'cool'
